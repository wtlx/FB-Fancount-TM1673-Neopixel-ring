Watching Becky Stern's Youtube-Video about her Facebook Fancounter, I wanted to have one too. (https://www.instructables.com/id/Social-Stats-Tracker-Display-With-ESP8266/)
But due to API-changes it needs a workaround for me to work without registering an app. 
The downside: You need your own webspace and you have to find a website which display the fancount already.

To display the Number of fans I've used a blue TM1673. 
Because my script is using another website and I don't want to be banned or something, I have big intervalls for updating the fancount.
To give the viewers of my Counter and potential fans of the fb-site, I added a 16x Neopixel ring, which visualize the time until the next refresh.
